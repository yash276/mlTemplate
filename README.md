Full disclousre this is not my code.
I am following Abhishek Takhur a Kaggle GrandMaster on youtube and this code can be found on this youtube tutorials and on his github profile as well.

But ofcourse I have made some tweaks to the original code as per my taste and have made it a little bit better and robust.

For any references you can check out the links below for this profile.
