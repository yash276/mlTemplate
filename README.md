# mlTemplate

The inspiration of this code came to me since I am too lazy to write the code again and again.
So I wanted to create a ML pipeline that can quickly tell me various things about my data and also can try the basic Linear and Logistic Regression on that and give me more details.
The idea is not to solve the problem at hand entirely rather a quick sneak peak inside the data and see what all things are possible with it.

## Full disclousre 
The Base code is taken from Abhishek Takhur a Kaggle GrandMaster on youtube and this code can be found on this youtube tutorials and on his github profile as well.

But ofcourse I have made some tweaks and additions to the original code as per my taste and have made it a little bit better and robust and refined it to suit my pupose.
